what is hill-shading?
Hillshading is a technique used to visualize terrain as shaded relief, illuminating it with a hypothetical light source. The illumination value for each raster cell is determined by its orientation to the light source, which is based on slope and aspect. In the lab activity, you will experiment with placement of the light source, but, for now, it will suffice to say that positioning the light source in the northwest works best to simulate a natural landscape to the human eye. Depending on your application, you might also want to simulate the true position of the sun at a particular date and time of year.
