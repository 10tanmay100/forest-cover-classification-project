# forest-cover-classification-project
Problem Statement: Forest land is highly required for developing ecosystem management. Any changes that  occur in ecosystem should be carefully noticed to avoid further loss. This model is  helpful in noticing the changes occurred due to heavy floods or any other calamities  which affected the forest land. The goal is to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of  the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado with the best accuracy Four wilderness areas are: 1: Rawah 2: Neota 3: Comanche Peak 4: Cache la Poudre Seven categories numbered from 1 to 7 in the Cover_Type column, to be classified: 1: Spruce/Fir 2: Lodgepole Pine 3: Ponderosa Pine 4: Cottonwood/Willow 5: Aspen 6: Douglas-fir 7: Krummholz
